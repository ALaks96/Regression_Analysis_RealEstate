# Regression Analysis RealEstate

This project was the midterm of my Regression course at Ecole Polytechnique. 

We were tasked to conduct a thorough regression analysis of Real Estate data, providing an appendix containing all our development and a summarized version containing main results. 

The methods used (hypothesis testing, linear regression) were ours to choose but were always expected to be justified and the results they yielded explained in detail. Good diagnostics at every step of the analysis were expected as well.
